"""Regression guards for the documented install instructions.

The distribution name is read from ``[project] name`` in pyproject.toml, never
hardcoded, so a future rename cannot leave the docs pointing at a package that
does not exist. Two facts are pinned here:

1. Nothing is published on PyPI yet, so the docs must install from git. A bare
   ``pip install <name>`` line in the docs is a 404 for the reader.
2. The name ``ghstats`` on PyPI belongs to an unrelated third-party project
   (kefir500/ghstats, "GitHub Release download count and other statistics.",
   v2.0.0, by Alexander Gorishnyak), so it must never be offered as an install
   target -- not now, not in any future commit. Same problem domain, different
   author, which is exactly what makes it a trap: a reader who copies the
   documented install line silently gets someone else's program installed and
   believes it is this one. That name belongs to another author permanently, so
   it stays in FORBIDDEN_TARGETS even after this project is published.

Note the repo name and the distribution name differ: the repo is ``ghstats``
(also the console script, the command the user types), the distribution is
``ghstats-py``.

Only the first fact flips on publication. Publishing is gated on creating the
project on PyPI and registering a trusted publisher; once
``pip install ghstats-py`` resolves, the git line becomes unnecessary and the
bare install of *that* name becomes correct. Flip ``PUBLISHED`` in that same
commit -- do not leave a guard that forces one of two wrong states. The
``ghstats`` entry does not move with the flag.
